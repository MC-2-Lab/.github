## Welcome to MC2-Lab 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)



## Colla Git
Since github does not support multi-person private warehouse cooperation, in order to facilitate the code sharing, review and communication of non-open source projects among team members, you can join the gitlab team for private warehouse cooperation:

- [BUAA-Gitlab-CN](http://43.138.61.103:8081/mygitlab-mc-2)  mygitlab-mc-2
